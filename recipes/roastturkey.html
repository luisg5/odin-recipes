  <!-- Steps Section -->
  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Remove the package of giblets and neck from the turkey cavity. Rinse
      the turkey with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Tie the ends
      of the drumsticks together.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Brush
      the turkey with the oil. Season with the salt and black pepper. Insert
      a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, not touching the
      bone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir the stock, lemon juice, basil, thyme and 1/8 teaspoon additional
      black pepper in a large bowl. Reserve 1 3/4 cups stock mixture for the
      gravy. Pour the remaining stock mixture over the turkey.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roast at 325 degrees F for 3 hours or until the thermometer reads 165
      degrees F., basting occasionally with the pan drippings. Begin checking
      for doneness after 2 1/2 hours of the roasting time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the turkey from the pan, cover and keep warm. Spoon off any fat
      and pour off all but 1 1/2 cups pan drippings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir the reserved stock mixture and the flour in a medium bowl until
      the mixture is smooth. Add the flour mixture to the pan. Cook and stir
      over medium heat until the mixture boils and thickens, scraping up the
      browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Season, if desired.
      Serve the gravy with the turkey.
    </li>
  </ol>
